# AVE-NvidiaTX1-iSight360
GPIO Breakout for iSight360

#Purpose
This PCB layout is intended to be for prototype purposes. This board fundamentally breaks out GPIO that is necessary for the iSight360 danger avoidence unit. Current build is limited to the layout and footprint size of the Development Carrier board provided by the Nvidia Jetson TX1. Future builds will include an all integrated carrier module to reduce overall footprint size.
